Prateek Jukalkar

What the program does: Takes the user's full name & age as input and prints a statement that includes the user's name and how old they are in years.

Installation documentation:
1) Open JupyterLab, press the "+" button (opens new Launcher), and select "Terminal" at the bottom 
2) Type in "cd" followed by the name of the directory where you would like to store the program
3) Type "git clone https://github.com/psjdev30/Week-6-Lab-Exercise.git" into the terminal
4) A folder called "Week-6-Lab-Exercise" should now appear with all the necessary files contained within it

Usage documentation:  To properly utilize this program, either click the "run" button or execute the "Shift Enter" key combination to execute the program. As the program asks for user input, provide appropriate responses by typing in the boxes and hit enter to view final output.  

How to contribute: To make changes, simply fork the repository and make modifications as you see fit.  Changes can be pushed back to the original repo or the modified program can be distributed/sold/merged/published separately if that is preferred.  Thank you!

LICENSE.md: The MIT license was chosen so that other open-source contributors can easily add to the program's code and afford more extensive functionalities for users.  I chose a license that is one of the most permissive because the program currently has no commercial value and would require extensive development to become a meaningful project, so limiting restrictions for open source community members to make modifications incentivizes them to contribute.  

CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md: The Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct was utilized because it is a standard and widely-used code of conduct that covers all the bases in terms of outlining the standards and responsibilities that come with contributing to this project as well as clearly defining the scope of the document and identifying a person of contact in the case that the code of conduct is violated.
